To write a new post, add a file in the `_posts` directory under the catagory you
want (probably `meeting-notes`) with the following naming scheme:

    YYYY-MM-DD-write-title-like-this.markdown

Look in `meeting-notes/_posts/` for examples. Then write markdown in that file.
Commit and push. If the post is any more than a couple of sentences long, or has
photos, etc. put four (4) new lines after the first paragraph to denote an
excerpt. This will keep the front page from getting to busy.

See [kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html) for markup help.
(This is the particular parser we use here).
