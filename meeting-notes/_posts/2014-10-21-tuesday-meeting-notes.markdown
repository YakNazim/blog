Crowdfunding update: Including a $2,000 donation from the Oregon IEEE, we're made over $7,000 of our $10,000 goal. There's 11 days left to raise funds, and we'll be working on getting out a corporate fundraising video to solicit funds from Garmin and Boeing.

Project updates

Motor study group
Working on parametric analysis using OpenRocket to get estimates for our design. This involves manipulating engine thrust, burn time, tank material to get an engine length and altitude estimate. The OpenRocket setup and Python engine script can be found in the GitHub Liquid Motor repo.

Airframe team
Working on getting a time from the capstone students so they can all come to give the CF Module fabrication training. 

CubeSat0 team
Still making initial design estimates. We're probably going to end up building a prototype that will never fly, for learning purposes. There's a general lack of learning materials available.

Capstones (RCS, Test Stand, Separation Ring)
Capstone presentation given last week (10/13). It went well and generated interest. The RCS capstone also recruited two more students and is almost ready to get off the ground

Software GPS
SPY isn't going to work, so focus is turning from the software to the hardware side for solutions.

GPS study group
New people joined the group, the meeting 10/21 was mostly spent catching people up on the basics.


MISC

Portland State of Mind (10/21)
This went well and generated substantial interest, with around 30 new sign-ups.

OROCK's Rocketober was a big success, with great weather and several big launches. 
	
National Association of Rocketry
	PSAS will preset at NAR 20-23 February; people interested in coming up should put it in their calendars.

Reminder to everyone to e-mail your friends and family about the crowdfunding campaign. There's less than two weeks left and we need almost $3,000 to meet our goal.In
