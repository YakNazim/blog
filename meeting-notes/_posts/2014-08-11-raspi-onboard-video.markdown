We posted our raspberry pi onboard video!

{% include youtube.html video="4tdJA9KQr98"%}





This view is from a [raspberry pi camera](http://www.raspberrypi.org/product/camera-module/)
mounted in the payload section of the rocket. We had it facing down with a fairly
wide field of view.


## What it captured

You can see how fast the rocket spins during the flight. While this isn't a
problem, it wasn't exactly what we wanted. More about that in the future.

The rocket only takes about 30 seconds to reach 5 kilometers in altitude. At
this point the nosecone is separated and a small drogue parachute is released.
We almost hit ourselves with the nosecone this time! The rocket falls on the
drogue for another three or more minutes until a very large parachute, the
"main", is opened and the rocket touches down softly. The several minutes of
parachute drifting is omitted.
