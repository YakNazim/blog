title: Update on PSAS' "rocket room"
---

As many of you know, PSAS' "rocket room" located in FAB 84-16 has been, well, demolished. That space is being renovated for the "Center for Interconnected Devices", which is the second incarnation of the Electronics Prototyping Lab (EPL) that's currently in FAB 60-10. There's good news and bad news here:




- The **bad news** is that we're mostly homeless during the scheduled 1.5 months of construction. Currently we have limited access to a Mark Faust's small work room in the robot lab area (FAB 70-07) (thanks Mark!). We also have some deep storage things in the Brano Pejcinovic's IC test lab (thanks Brano!), and we left some more stalwart things left in FAB 84 during construction. This will make the next 1.5 months very, very painful. We blame society.
- The **good news** is that as soon as the old EPL becomes the CID, we get the FAB 60-10 space!!11! Although it's harder to navigate to, FAB 60-10 is  a much nicer (and larger) space. We'll have ewnough room to permanently set up the rocket and and have smallish work parties there.

There's no moving date yet -- right now we only know that it's "before the Fall term starts". Hopefully, and possibly even likely, it's more like the middle of September.
