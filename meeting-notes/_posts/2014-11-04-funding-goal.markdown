We're excited to announce that we exceeded our $10,000 goal,
receiving a total of $10,100 in donations, about $2,000 of which
arrived within the last week of the campaign.  We are very grateful to
all of our donors!

This money will go to fund various important projects at PSAS,
including the student capstone projects dedicated to the liquid motor
test stand and the RCS.  This is one of the most successful funding
campaigns in our 16-year history, and we are looking forward to an
excellent year!
