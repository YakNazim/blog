title: Some GPS Success And Some Visualization
---

We've had a couple more weeks of GPS study group meetings and slowly we're
starting to catch up on how GPS works.

Notably we've taken our test data source and updated Jamey's old
[GPS FFT cross cross-correlation code](https://github.com/psas/gps)
and successfully "found" several satellites in the noise!

We spent last Tuesday meeting discussing how to use cross-correlation
between the noisy radio recording a crafted ideal GPS signal to "look"
for the hidden GPS data in the recording. This is based off of
[Andrew Holme's GPS FFT work](http://www.aholme.co.uk/GPU_FFT/Main.htm).

In addition Nathan has started doing some visualizations of basic GPS
encoding:
